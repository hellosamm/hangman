# hangman
Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

### Functionality
A command line hangman game where one player plays against the computer, trying to guess a randomly selected word that is between 5 and 12 characters. 

The user has the option at the beginning to start a new game or to load a saved game. Once a game is started you have 8 guesses to correctly guess the word. You may save your game progress and come back later to finish playing. 

If you correctly guess all the letters, you win! If you run out of guesses the secret word will be revealed. 

have fun!
